# ChipiPay Invisible Wallet Integration Summary

This document summarizes the complete ChipiPay invisible wallet integration implemented for merchant registration and contract interaction.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Enhanced ChipiPay Service (`services/chipipayService.ts`)

- **Real Wallet Creation**: Implemented the actual ChipiPay wallet creation flow using StarkNet and Argent X account creation
- **Contract Calls**: Updated to handle ChipiPay's expected format with encrypted private keys and PINs
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with specific ChipiPay error codes
- **Logging**: Detailed operation logging for debugging and monitoring

### 2. Enhanced Merchant Registration Service (`services/merchantRegistrationService.ts`)

- **Invisible Wallet Creation**: `createInvisibleWallet()` method for creating ChipiPay wallets
- **Contract Registration**: `registerMerchantOnContract()` method for registering merchants on the smart contract
- **Complete Flow**: `registerMerchantWithInvisibleWallet()` method that handles the entire registration process
- **Metadata Handling**: Proper conversion of business data to felt252 format for contract storage

### 3. Enhanced Contract Merchant Service (`services/contractMerchantService.ts`)

- **ChipiPay Integration**: Methods to interact with the contract using ChipiPay wallets
- **Merchant Registration**: `registerMerchantWithChipiPay()` for contract registration
- **Wallet Management**: Methods to update withdrawal addresses and metadata
- **Fund Operations**: `withdrawFunds()` method for merchant fund withdrawals

### 4. Crypto Utilities (`lib/chipipay-crypto.ts`)

- **Encryption/Decryption**: Utilities for handling private key encryption
- **Secure Storage**: Methods for securely storing wallet data in browser storage
- **Validation**: Functions to validate private keys and encrypted data
- **Password Generation**: Secure password generation for additional encryption

### 5. Type Definitions (`services/types/chipipay.types.ts`)

- **Updated Interfaces**: Enhanced interfaces to support the new ChipiPay integration
- **Contract Call Parameters**: Proper typing for contract calls with encrypted keys
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error type definitions

### 6. Utility Functions (`lib/utils.ts`)

- **Contract Addresses**: Added contract address constants with environment variable support

## Key Features

### Invisible Wallet Creation
```typescript
const walletResult = await MerchantRegistrationService.createInvisibleWallet(
  merchantData,
  bearerToken,
  apiPublicKey
);
```

### Complete Registration Flow
```typescript
const result = await MerchantRegistrationService.registerMerchantWithInvisibleWallet(
  merchantData,
  bearerToken,
  apiPublicKey,
  contractAddress
);
```

### Contract Interactions
```typescript
const contractService = new ContractMerchantService(null, contractAddress);
const txHash = await contractService.withdrawFunds(
  encryptedPrivateKey,
  walletPublicKey,
  amount,
  encryptKey,
  bearerToken
);
```

## Security Features

1. **Double Encryption**: Private keys are encrypted by ChipiPay and can be additionally encrypted for local storage
2. **PIN Protection**: All contract operations require the user's PIN to decrypt private keys
3. **Secure Storage**: Utilities for secure browser storage with additional encryption layers
4. **Validation**: Comprehensive validation of private keys and encrypted data

## Integration Points

### With Existing Merchant Registration
- Seamlessly integrates with existing database registration flow
- Maintains backward compatibility with wallet-based and Google authentication
- Handles partial failures gracefully (e.g., wallet created but contract registration fails)

### With Smart Contract
- Proper integration with the `register_merchant` function in the EgyptFi contract
- Metadata hash generation from business information
- Support for all contract operations (registration, updates, withdrawals)

### With Authentication System
- Uses existing bearer token authentication
- Integrates with external user IDs from auth providers
- Maintains session security

## Error Handling

- **Network Errors**: Timeout handling and retry logic
- **Authentication Errors**: Proper handling of invalid tokens
- **Contract Errors**: Detailed error messages for contract call failures
- **Encryption Errors**: Validation and error handling for key operations
- **Partial Failures**: Graceful handling when some operations succeed and others fail

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite covering:
- Wallet creation scenarios
- Contract registration flows
- Error conditions
- Integration scenarios
- Partial failure handling

## Documentation

- **Integration Examples**: Complete examples showing how to use the services
- **React Components**: Example React components for UI integration
- **Dependencies Guide**: Instructions for installing required packages
- **Security Considerations**: Best practices for secure implementation

## Environment Configuration

Required environment variables:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHIPIPAY_API_KEY=pk_prod_your_key
CHIPIPAY_URL=https://api.chipipay.com/v1
STARKNET_RPC_URL=https://starknet-mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_PROJECT_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_EGYPT_SEPOLIA_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x...
```

## Next Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install crypto-js @avnu/gasless-sdk`
2. **Configure Environment**: Set up the required environment variables
3. **Test Integration**: Run the test suite to verify everything works
4. **Implement UI**: Use the provided React component examples
5. **Deploy**: Follow the deployment checklist for production

## Benefits

- **Frictionless Onboarding**: Users don't need to manage wallets or gas fees
- **Security**: Private keys are encrypted and never exposed
- **Scalability**: Gasless transactions reduce barriers to adoption
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing systems
- **Flexibility**: Supports both invisible wallets and traditional wallet connections
